# Bootstrap Css custom styling

Greetings!
Please view the "bootstrap.css" file and see how you can customize your own Bootstrap classes!

1. Access "bootstrap.css" 
2. Ctrl + F
3. Find ".ky-flex-center" to center your body/main/section element
4. Find ".ky-nav-flex-row-sm", ".ky-nav-flex-row", ".ky-nav-flex-row-lg" and the different nav-list sizes!

## How to use:
In order to effectively use bootstrap in your projects, you can either: 
1. ```<script>``` a link from the web.
    example:
            ```<link href=" https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css " rel="stylesheet">```
2. Open your terminal and run node package manager (npm) to install the latest version of Bootstrap.
    example: 
        a. Ensure you are in the correct directory that you would like to install your Bootstrap module.
        b. type ```npm init```
        c. type ```npm isntall bootstrap -y```
        d. You will notice a folder is created called "node_modules"
        e. Access bootstrap with this path: [Current Directory]\node_modules\bootstrap\dist\css\bootstrap.css
        f. Now you can look at all of the cool bootstrap class customizations...and you can make your own too! Look at how I did mine in the previous steps above.

        **Important** - Link your "bootstrap.css" file to your index.html file (or project origin). 
                        example: ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap.css"></link>```

    Enjoy!
